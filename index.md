## Twitter Data Products 

--- 

## How it works
The first user you input should be your brand and the other two the competitors. 
The users should be entered as: "@brand" or "brand"

Be patience it might take a couple of minutes to load the data from TW

Each TW user you input retreives the latest 100 mentions*. 
*There might be some cases when there are not enough mentions to retreive, there are some blank tweets due to the change in RT's by Twitter.

## Time and interactions analysis. 
I was not able to make this using the dynamic data, but I've included a sample of the analysis 
Tweets are separated to get the ones made exclusively by each brand and the number of RTs and Fav is added into interactions.
