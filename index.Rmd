## Twitter Data Products 

--- 

## How it works
The first user you input should be your brand and the other two the competitors. The users should be entered as: “@brand”

Each TW user you input retreives the latest 500 mentions*. *There might be some cases when there are not enough mentions to retreive

Tweets are separated to get the ones made exclusively by each brand and the number of RTs and Fav is added into interactions.
